Answers to HW8 Questions
========================

a)  How to detect when a page is accessed?
We can set the permissions of the page using mprotect() to PROT_NONE, which
means any access will cause a segfault. Therefore, we can create a boolean
flag to become true once a segfault occurs, meaning that the page was
accessed. Once it has been accessed, we must change the permissions to
PROT_READ, which we can then read the page contents from. The end product
is the contents being read and the flag set to true.

b)  How to detect when a page becomes dirty?
A page becomes dirty when it becomes modified. Therefore, we need to look
for when someone writes to the page. Similar to part a, we can set the
permissions to PROT_READ, and this will segfault when writes are attempted.
We can mark a flag saying that an attempt to write has occurred and change
the permissions to PROT_READ and PROT_WRITE. Lastly, we fulfill the
actualy request to make sure the write happened.

f)  Page-load rate of "test_matrix -m 1024 1000" using RANDOM policy: 50611


g)  Page Replacement Policy #1 (fill in the information below)

Name of policy you chose to implement: FIFO

Below, give the command-line for invoking the matrix-test program for a
1000x1000 matrix, with a maximum of 1024 resident pages.  (If multiple
steps are required, list them all here.)

  >>> ./test_matrix_fifo -m 1024 1000

Give the resulting page-load rate of the above command: 47944

If you have any additional information to share about your policy, please
share it here.  Please keep your comments brief; you don't need to repeat
what the assignment says about the policy here.


h)  Page Replacement Policy #2 (if you implemented two policies)

Name of policy you chose to implement: Aging

Below, give the command-line for invoking the matrix-test program for a
1000x1000 matrix, with a maximum of 1024 resident pages.  (If multiple
steps are required, list them all here.)

  >>> ./test_matrix_aging -m 1024 1000

Give the resulting page-load rate of the above command: 6728

If you have any additional information to share about your policy, please
share it here.  Please keep your comments brief; you don't need to repeat
what the assignment says about the policy here.

Resulting page-load rates for different bits:
8 bits of age: 6968
16 bits of age: 6728
32 bits of age: 6733
64 bits of age: 6775

There is not really any significant change.
