Although all the numbers are matched with the correct result, the obvious
problem is that the program only outputs results from producer 0. This
shows that cooperative thread execution is not fair, since producer 0 is
outputting everything instead of both producers. Producer 0 fills the buffer
first since it is first to enter its while loop. Then, producer 0 yields
once the buffer is filled. However, since the buffer is filled, producer 1
is also forced to yield. Afterwards, the consumer runs, which frees some
values in the buffer. Since producer 0 yielded first, it then runs again
until the buffer is full again. This is unfair since producer 1 is never
allowed to stop yielding and does not output anything.
