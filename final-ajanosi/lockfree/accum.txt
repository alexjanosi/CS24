This implementation is lock-free. There are certain situations where a certain
thread could run forever in the while loop implemented. For example, if other
threads were being updated constantly, we would always be in a situation where
we use compare_and_swap correctly. This would cause our while loop to run over
and over again. Since the threads are being changed as the comparison is 
happening, we could never have a successful operation, and the thread could
take an unbounded amount of time.
